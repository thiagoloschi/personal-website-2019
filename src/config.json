My team is responsible for creating world class connected devices that will boost shoppers experience from the moment they walk in the store until they're ready to leave, making it also possible for them to continue shopping from home.\n\n There are two main React applications we're building and they're mostly being built using Redux, Nextjs, Electron, Webpack, Jest and Enzyme. The main one will be used on our fitting room's smart mirrors.\n\n I'm currently working on two product lines, the Store of The Future and the Black and White platform. Our core clients are huge and well known fashion brands like Chanel, Thom Browne and Browns and we always keep in mind the idea of having our products ready to be used for new clients in the future.",
